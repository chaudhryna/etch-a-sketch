# etch-a-sketch

An Odin Project challenge built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  The challenge is to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch in order to learn DOM manipulation.

There are a few features I'd like to add in the future but this is an MVP for now.
